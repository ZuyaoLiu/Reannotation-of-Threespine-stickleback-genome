# Reannotation-of-Threespine-stickleback-genome

This repo contains the scripts and steps used to annotate the latest assemby of the threespine stickleback genome (Nath et al 2020).

We have used a three step approach, annotating genes based on:
  1) homology to curated protein databases
  2) transcript alignments from multiple RNAseq experiments
  3) <i>ab initio</i> gene prediction (using gene prediction models trained on annotations from 1) and 2). 
  
Please see the Wiki for details of this annotation.
